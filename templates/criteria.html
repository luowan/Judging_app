    <h2>ABAX Hackathon Scoring System Rules</h2>
    <p>The ABAX Hackathon scoring system is designed to fairly and transparently evaluate each project based on judges’ assessments and employee votes. The total possible score for a project is <strong>100 points</strong>, divided between judges’ evaluations and employee voting.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Judges’ Evaluation (70 Points Total)</h3>
    <ul class="sub-list">
        <li><strong>Number of Judges:</strong> 7</li>
        <li><strong>Scoring Range per Judge:</strong> Each judge awards a score between <strong>0 and 10</strong> for each project.</li>
        <li><strong>Total Judges’ Score per Project:</strong> The sum of all judges’ scores, ranging from <strong>0 to 70 points</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Calculation Details</h4>
    <ul class="sub-list">
        <li><strong>Maximum Possible Score from Judges:</strong> 7 judges × 10 points = <strong>70 points</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Possible Score from Judges:</strong> 7 judges × 0 points = <strong>0 points</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Employee Voting (30 Points Total)</h3>
    <ul class="sub-list">
        <li><strong>Voting Eligibility:</strong> All ABAX employees are invited to participate in the voting process.</li>
        <li><strong>Voting Mechanism:</strong> Employees vote for their favorite projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Points Allocation Based on Employee Votes:</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <table class="scoring-table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Rank</th>
                <th>Points Awarded</th>
            </tr>

    </table>
    
    <p><strong>Tie Handling:</strong> In case of a tie in employee votes, the projects will share the points for the tied positions equally.</p>
    
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <p>If two projects tie for 2nd place, both projects receive:</p>
    <p><strong>(25 points for 2nd place + 20 points for 3rd place) ÷ 2 = 22.5 points each.</strong></p>
    
    <h3>3. Total Project Score</h3>
    <ul class="sub-list">
        <li><strong>Maximum Total Score:</strong> 100 points (70 from judges + 30 from employee voting)</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Total Score:</strong> 0 points</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Final Score Calculation:</strong> Total Score for a Project = <em>Sum of Judges’ Scores</em> + <em>Employee Voting Points</em></p>
    
    <h3>4. Determining the Winners</h3>
    <ul class="sub-list">
        <li>Projects are ranked based on their <strong>Total Project Scores</strong>.</li>
        <li>The project with the <strong>highest total score</strong> is declared the <strong>winner</strong> of the hackathon.</li>
        <li><strong>Runners-up</strong> are determined by descending order of total scores.</li>
        <li><strong>In Case of a Tie:</strong></li>
        <ul class="sub-sub-list">
            <li>The project with the higher <strong>Judges’ Total Score</strong> will be ranked higher.</li>
            <li>If the tie persists, the projects share the position.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>5. Scoring Guidelines</h3>
    <h4>Judges’ Scoring</h4>
    <ul class="sub-list">
        <li><strong>Evaluation Criteria:</strong> Judges will score projects based on predefined criteria, such as:
            <ul class="nested-list">
                <li>Empower People</li>
                <li>Strategic Alignment</li>
                <li>Innovation & Creativity</li>
                <li>Impact Potential (ROI & Effort)</li>
                <li>Presentation and Demo Quality</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Scoring Scale:</strong>
            <ul class="nested-list">
                <li><strong>0:</strong> Does not meet the criterion at all.</li>
                <li><strong>5:</strong> Meets the criterion satisfactorily.</li>
                <li><strong>10:</strong> Exceeds the criterion exceptionally.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Independence:</strong> Judges must evaluate projects independently without consulting other judges.</li>
    </ul>
